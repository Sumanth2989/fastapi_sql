Setting up the FastAPI and PostgreSQL environment using Docker Compose was a highly insightful experience. It provided a practical understanding of how containerization simplifies the management of multi-service applications. Initially, I encountered issues with Docker connectivity and environment variable configurations, which taught me the importance of verifying that the Docker daemon is running and .env files are correctly referenced. Once resolved, I was able to spin up all three services—FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin—successfully.
Working with pgAdmin allowed me to directly visualize how relational data is structured and managed. Creating the users and calculations tables helped reinforce the concept of one-to-many relationships using foreign keys. Executing SQL operations such as INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE provided hands-on experience with CRUD functionality and query execution flow. Seeing how updates and deletions reflected instantly in the database strengthened my understanding of referential integrity.
One of the biggest challenges was resolving the “module import” issue in FastAPI when the app directory was mis-mounted in Docker. Debugging this taught me how volumes can override container code and how correct working directories matter in containerized applications. Overall, this project deepened my understanding of container orchestration, database integration, and debugging across multiple services—all essential skills for modern backend development.
